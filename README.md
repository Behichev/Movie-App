# Movie-App

My small app is based on TMDb API, in here you can add the newest films or TVs to your favorite list, and search media in the big TMDb library. I used:
- [Realm](https://github.com/realm/realm-swift) for saving data
- [SDWebImage](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage) for caching images
- [YouTube iOS Helper player](https://github.com/youtube/youtube-ios-player-helper) for trailers.
