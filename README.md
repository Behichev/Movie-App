# Movie-App

My small app is based on [TMDb API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3), in here you can add the newest films or TVs to your favorite list, and search media in the big TMDb library. 

I used:
- [Realm](https://github.com/realm/realm-swift) for saving data
- [SDWebImage](https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImage) for caching images
- [YouTube iOS Helper player](https://github.com/youtube/youtube-ios-player-helper) for trailers.
