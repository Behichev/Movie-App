# Movie-App

My small app is based on [TMDb API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3), in here you can add the newest films or TV's to your favorite list, and search media in the big TMDb library. 

I used:
- [Realm](https://github.com/realm/realm-swift) for saving data
- URLSession for network requests
- Cache manager for caching images 
- MVC Architecture 

install realm woith SPM
